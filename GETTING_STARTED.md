cd backend

# Install new packages
npm install joi express-rate-limit winston nodemailer razorpay cloudinary
```

✅ Check: All packages should install without errors

---

### Step 2️⃣: Configure Environment (3 minutes)

Create a file `backend/.env` with your configuration:

```env
# REQUIRED - Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/harish-cloths

# REQUIRED - Security
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=change_this_to_a_random_secret_key_12345

# REQUIRED - Admin Account
ADMIN_EMAIL=owner@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=replace-with-a-strong-unique-password

# REQUIRED - Server
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000

# OPTIONAL - Email (Gmail)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_EMAIL=your_gmail@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@harishcloths.com

# OPTIONAL - Images (Cloudinary)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# OPTIONAL - Payments (Razorpay)
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_1234567890
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# OPTIONAL - Frontend
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

✅ Check: Create `.env` file and verify MongoDB is running

---

### Step 3️⃣: Start the Server (5 minutes)

```bash
# Start development server with auto-reload
npm run dev

# Expected output:
# Backend running on port 3000
# ✅ MongoDB connected
# ✅ Default admin created
```

✅ Check: Server starts without errors on port 3000

---

## 🧪 Test It Works (Next 5 minutes)

### Test 1: Get Products
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/products
```

Expected: Returns array of products (may be empty initially)

---

### Test 2: Register a Customer
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "9876543210",
    "password": "password123",
    "confirmPassword": "password123"
  }'
```

Expected: Returns JWT token and customer data

---

### Test 3: Login as Admin
```bash
curl -c admin.cookies -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/admin/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

orderController       → Order creation, tracking
reviewController      → Reviews, ratings
paymentController     → Razorpay integration
adminController       → Admin operations
```

### Routes (API Endpoints)
```
/api/v1/auth/*        → Customer authentication

## 🎯 Common Tasks

### Create a Product (Admin)
1. Login as admin
2. POST to `/api/v1/admin/products`
3. Send product data (name, price, description, brand, category)
4. Product is created in database

### Create an Order (Customer)
1. Login as customer
2. POST to `/api/v1/orders`
3. Send items array and shipping address
4. Order is created in database
5. Razorpay order created for payment

### Process a Payment
1. Frontend shows Razorpay modal
2. Customer completes payment
3. Razorpay calls webhook
4. Backend verifies signature
5. Order status updated to "paid"

### Request a Return
1. Customer requests return via API
2. Return document created
3. Admin reviews and approves
4. Refund processed via Razorpay

## 🔐 Authentication

### JWT Token Format
```
Header.Payload.Signature

Payload contains:
- user ID
- user role (customer/admin)
- issued at time
- expiration time
```

### How to Use Token
```bash
# Include token in Authorization header
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token_here>" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/profile
```

### Token Expiration
- Tokens expire after 30 days
- User must login again to get new token
- Tokens stored in browser localStorage

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module 'joi'"
**Solution:** Run `npm install joi express-rate-limit winston nodemailer razorpay`

### "MONGODB_URI is not defined"
**Solution:** Add `MONGODB_URI` to `.env` file

### "listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000"
**Solution:** 
- Option 1: Change PORT in `.env` to 3001
- Option 2: Kill process: `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9` (Linux/Mac)

### "jwt malformed"
**Solution:** Token is invalid or corrupted, user needs to login again

### "Email failed to send"
**Solution:** Check SMTP credentials in `.env`, enable less secure apps if using Gmail

### "Razorpay order creation failed"
**Solution:** Verify `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` and `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` are correct

## 📱 Testing Tools

### Postman (Recommended)
1. Download from https://www.postman.com/downloads/
2. Create requests for each endpoint
3. Set Authorization header for protected routes
4. Save requests in collection

### cURL (Command Line)
```bash
# GET request
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/products

# POST request
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"pass123"}'

# With Authorization
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/profile
```

### VSCode REST Client
Install "REST Client" extension and create `.http` file:
```http
### Get Products
GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/products

### Register Customer
POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "phone": "9876543210",
  "password": "password123",
  "confirmPassword": "password123"
}
```
